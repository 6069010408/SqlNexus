<p class=MsoNormal>Customizing Reports</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can customize the reports included with SQL Nexus using the
report designer in either SQL Server Reporting Services or Visual Studio.  Visual
Studio features a report designer specifically intended for client-side report
development, but it is less functional than the one included with SQL Server
Reporting Services.  Because the VS report viewer control does not support
certain features when working with client-side reports, it does not expose
these features during design-time even though both SQL Nexus and SQL Server Reporting
Services support them.  Therefore, some people find it easier to design reports
as RDL files using the SSRS report designer, then rename them for client-side
use.  You can use either designer to customize the reports included with SQL
Nexus, although we strongly recommend that you first make a copy of a report
you want to change and edit the copy rather than the original.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Studying the built-in reports is also great way to learn
about the capabilities of the rendering engine.  RDL and RDLC files are simply
XML documents that the designers use to instruct the report rendering engine on
how to create the report.</p>
